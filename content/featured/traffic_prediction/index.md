An analytics and [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353229995_When_and_where_Proactively_predicting_traffic_accident_in_South_Africa_our_machine_learning_competition_winning_approach) using machine learning algorithm to predict the hourly probability of traffic incidents along major road line in South Africa. The algorithm was the 3rd ðŸ¥‰ best in Zindi's Movement [Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/2030-vision-data-visualization-and-reporting-challenge/discussions/1593).
